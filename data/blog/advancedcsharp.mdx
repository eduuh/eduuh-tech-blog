Advanced csharp concepts gives use more abstraction of the logic unlike the basic csharp concecpts.

1. Delegates
2. Extension Methods
3. Events
4. Extension Methods
5. Lambda Expressions
6. LINQ
7. Asyncronous Programming (async / await)
8. Reflections
9. Attributes

## What makes programming concepts more advanced concepts?

The more abstract the concept the more difficult the concept is to understand for most people.

### What is Abstract.

- Theory of forms.

### Why undestand abstract concepts?

Gaining an undertanding of the more abstract advanced concepts can be applied to achieve better code

1. Better code reuse.
2. Cleaner code.
3. Extensibility.
4. Flexibility of design.
5. Easier maintenance of code.
6. Separation of concerns.
7. Enablement of effective unit testing.
8. Provision of overall better performance and efficiency of our applicaiton.

## Code.

- Sum is and Extension Method
- Sum take in a delegate.

## Linq - Language intergrated Query

Queries that work on strongly typed collection of objects.

```csharp
var employeesNames = employeesList.where(e => e.Salary > 30000)
                    .Select(e => e)
                    .where(d => d.DepartmentId ===2)
                    .Select(e => e.EmployeeName);
```

## Extension Methods

Allows the developer to add methods to existing types without creating a new derived types, recompiling or otherwise modifiying the existing types.

```csharp
public static class MyExtensions {
   public static int wordCount(this String str) {
        return str.Split(new char[] { '','',''}, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;
     }
}
```

### Delegates. (Type safe function pointer)

Delegate is a type that represent references to methods with a particular parameter list and return types.

```csharp

  class Program {
   delegate void Del(int i, double j);

   static void Main(string[] args) {

     Del d = MultiplyNumbers;

     for(int i=1; i <= 5; i++) {
        del(i,2);
      }
  }
    static void MultiplyNumbers(int m , double n){
       Console.Write(m * n + "");
    }
}

```

## Lambda Expression

A shorter way of representing an ananomous method using a special syntax. Func types allow use to represent and store anonoymous method in a simple way.

```csharp
Func<string,string> selector = str => str.Toupper();
```
