## Problems with Arrays

- Array have to have a fixed size and this is done at compile time. Users use the program at runtime.
- The advantages of arrays is that the elements are contigous. Think of an array as a `bench`.

- If we want to give the user the authority to add any number of items they want, we cannot use an array.
- Array is create inside a stack or heap.

## Linked List

We have free space and whoever is comming in should bring his/her chair. Linked list is also very easy to insert or remove element from the linked list. Linked List are only create inside the heap.

A linked list is like a list of Nodes.
