## Learning is a continual process.

Being a good rider means that you never stop learning. Machines and riding
conditons are constantly changings therefore my riding competency needs to
keep pace with the changes otherwise you will become outdated and dangerous.
`Aim to constantly review`, where necessary adapt you riding so you maintain
high standards and continually improve your performance.

Every time you ride, use the journey as an opportunity to develop your riding
ability. Accecpt every near miss and collision as a learning opportunity to
decide how you can avoid the same mistake in the future.

## My riding character.

1. All Gear all the time. (AGAT). That is Helmet, Armored Jacket, Knee
   Protection, Warm Clothes 2 Jackets, 2 trousers and 2 pair socks.

2. Planing my long rides.

   - Distance (Fuel range), Stops are important to recover from fatigue.
   - Food and refreshments.
   - How is the weather? Should i carry rain gear? on entirely avoid the rain?

3. No Music in traffic or Take a longer route with no traffic.

4. Unfamiliar roads: Have google maps. Both screen and Audio.

5. Riding is voe to remain sober. Keeping off any type of drugs.

6. Start early and arrive early. Don't let time pressure you.

7. Ride to be seen. Make sure you stand out in the background

8. Group riding: Give informationg, Take information. Make decisions based on
   the information. Never use anyones judgements. `Ride your ride`.

## Important operation to master.

I came across, this term `mental riding`. What does it really mean? Developing
these complex abilities begins with training but is a process of continous
improvement. It need constand practice and accurate self-assessment.

#### Multi-tasking

Being able to carry out several complex riding tasks at the same time and with
equal accuracy and efficiency.

#### Alertness.

Being vigilant and remaining focused so as to sport potential hazards early and
leave nothing to chance.

#### Attention distribution

Splitting you attention across all aspect of a riding task.

#### Situation awareness

Using all your senses to build up an accurate mental picture of the operation
environment.

#### Anticipation

Using your observation skills and riding experience to spot actual and potential
hazards and predict how the situation is likely to unfold.

#### Planning

Planing precisely and making rapid and accurate decisions throughout the task.

- Plan your exit, plan you stop and plan your turns.

#### Making judgements.

Judging situations accurately and taking safe and appropriate action.

## Minimize the chances of becoming a stastitics.

Fact: Riding a motocycle doesn't increase your changes of a collision compared
to driving a car, but for riders the outcomes tends to be more severe.

Riders are far more exposed in a collision that caged drivers. A rider is more
likely to be killed or injured, even in minor collisions.

Motocyles riders are:

- 50 times more likely to be killed or seriously injured than car drivers.
- 13 times more likely to be involeved in a crash which results in injury

#### Commonest causes of motorcyle crashes

1. `Right of way violations` - Drivers who look but fail to see.

   - A driver looks and fails to see a motocyle rider and pulls out across
     their path, mainly on urbans roads at low speeds.

2. `Loss of control on a bend, corner or curve on a rural road.` - This purely a
   riders fault. More likely to be fatal because fo the speeds involved as even
   small mistake can result to loss of control.

   - Mostly common on unfamiliar roads. `Found: google maps can help you undestand how the road will unfold.`

3. `Error in judgement` in manoeuring the machine, often in low speed. This type
   of collision tends to results from poor bike-handling skills or loss in
   concentration.

4. `Overtaking` in about 1 in 8 collisions, the rider was making an overtaking
   manoeuvre just before collision. `Never overtake, when you cannot see. i.e in bends, and a hill`.

#### Hazards for my current ride

1. Cold weather: You become sluggish and lose attention.
2. Road surface conditions: Road paint, sand and mud.

#### Areas of Improvement (Picked from Ubuntu 2023)

1. Ride to be seen. I can do better here. Action: Bug reflective clothes.

#### Self-assessment

1. What is my aim?
2. What went well and why?
3. What went less well and why?
4. How could I do better next time?
5. Have I been honest with myself?

#### Information

You ability to process complex information is essential to becoming a better
rider. `TUG` take, use and give information.

- Take information and plan you riding.
- Give information whenever other road users could benefit from it.

Motocyling is combination of position ,speed,gear and acceleration. You never
assume.

Whenever you consider changing position or speed, always check first what is
happening to the `front`, `sides` and `behind you`.

Sould your horn when you think another road user could benefit but remember its
purpose is to alert them you are there.

#### lifesaver check

This is the last check to the side into the blind spots before you commit
yourself to a manoeuvre. Do it just before the action.
