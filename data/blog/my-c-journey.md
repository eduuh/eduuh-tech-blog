Preparing for my Techical interviews, I fell in love with data structures and algorithms problems. After some research I decided to take up C++ as my tool for competitive programming. This is my journey to becoming a competitive programmer.

#### 1. [C++ Standard Template Library Review](/blog/c-for-competitive-programming). Learning how to use the Standard Library Template and Inbuild Algorithms.

#### 2. [C++ STL Container Iterators](/blog/c-interators). How to use Iterators with various C++ Containers.

#### 3. [C++ Fast Environment Setup](/blog/c-fast-enviroment-setup). Creating necessary files and debugging configuration very farst with one shell command `prg`.
